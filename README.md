## Macrotiod

This is my Attempt at learning rust through game development. I am trying to create a basic clone of Demon Attack for the Atari.
The code written for this project is not very good, everything is in one file and all over the place but it was my first attempt to really learn rust aswell as learn how game dev would feel with rust.

## Tools used
* Rust
* Macroquad (game framework)

## How to play
Download the project and run **cargo run** in the console and it should work.
# Controls
* A/D to move left and right.
* Space to shoot.
# Rules
* you have 3 lives you lose a live when an enemy gets to the bottom of the screen.
* you get points for destrying enemies.

## What Isn't implemented
* Sounds and music
* Different enemy types
* Powerups
* UI for menu and end screen
I would love to add these features but the code has become pretty bad and I feel like it would be better to just start a new project as I keep learning **Rust**
